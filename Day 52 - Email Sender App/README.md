### Email Sender App
In this tutorial ([Open in Youtube](https://youtu.be/7H8mrKTyYT4)),  I am gonna showing to you how to code a Responsive Email Sender using html, css and javascript! in this project we will use Emailjs api to send emails. Also we have a awesome modern design in this project ❗️

## Warning
You need to get your own api keys (in video we showed how!) and replace it in script.js file on line 1 and 15 :

```javascript
emailjs.init("PUBLIC_KEY");
```
```javascript
emailjs.send("SERVICE_ID", "TEMPLATE_ID", {
```
